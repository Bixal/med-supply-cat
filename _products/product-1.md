## Planning and Warehousing 

**Shelf life**: 7 years (Use life: 10 years)

**Special Considerations**:

- Any break or perforation of sterile package makes product non-sterile. Signs of water damage to packaging indicate that sterility is compromised; discard such packages.
- Copper IUDs sometimes tarnish; copper tarnish does not affect IUD efficacy or safety and does not indicate that package seal has been broken.
- Do not confuse shelf life with use life; an IUD may be inserted at any time during its shelf life, at which time its use life begins.
- IUD insertion requires specialized equipment, disinfectant, and a supply of clean gloves, cotton, gauze, and sponges.
