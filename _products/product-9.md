## Planning and Warehousing 

**Shelf life**: Not applicable

**Special Considerations**:

- CycleBeads consist of 32 color-coded beads and a rubber marker (O-ring). Each set should be strung in the following order: Bead 1 – Red, Beads 2-7 – Brown, Beads 8-19 – White, Beads 20-26 – Brown, Bead 27 – Dark Brown, Beads 28-32 – Brown. The clasp has an arrow that points to the red bead and indicates which direction to move the marker. It is imperative that all sets of CycleBeads are strung in this order to ensure effectiveness.
- White beads glow in the dark.
- O-ring may break after prolonged use. The ring can be replaced by unscrewing clasp. Extra O-ring included with each set.
- CycleBeads should last indefinitely with proper storage and handling as they contain no active ingredients and are made of durable polypropyl­ ene plastic, a three-strand nylon string, and a nitrile rubber O-ring.
