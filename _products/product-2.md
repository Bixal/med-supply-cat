Store at room temperature (20-25°C, 68-77°F), away from direct sunlight. Injectables must always be stored upright and protected from freezing.

## Planning and Warehousing 

**Shelf life**: 5 years

**Special Considerations**:
- All injectables require a sterile syringe and 21- to 23-gauge needle for administration.
- Store vials upright to avoid problems with resuspension.
- To safely manage health care waste resulting from the use of these supplies, use sharps/safety boxes and correctly dispose of used needles, syringes, and open vials.
