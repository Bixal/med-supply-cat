## Planning and Warehousing 

**Shelf life**: 5 years (Use life: 5 years)

**Special Considerations**:

- Any break or perforation of sterile package makes product non-sterile. Signs of water damage to packaging indicate that sterility is compromised; discard such packages.
- Shelf life should not be confused with use life; im­ plants inserted at any time during their shelf life have a use life that is 5 years from the date of insertion.
